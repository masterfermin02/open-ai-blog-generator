Title: Mastering the Art of Blogging: Creating a PHP Blog from Scratch

Hello, coding enthusiasts! Welcome back to our corner of the internet. Today, we're stepping deep into the world of PHP. We'll take an in-depth look into one of the tried and tested methods to get hands-on working experience with PHP: creating a blog.

This task might appear daunting at first; however, with a step-by-step approach, you're bound to gain a solid grip on PHP. As a bonus, you'll also understand how server-side scripting languages facilitate dynamic web content.

Let’s delve into the steps now! 

Step 1: Setting up the Environment

The first step will be setting up your local environment. If you have not configured your PHP development environment yet, you might consider using tools like XAMPP or WAMP. These packages contain Apache, MySQL, and PHP, all the tools you need to run a dynamic blog.

Step 2: The Database

Head over to phpMyAdmin and create a new database for your blog. For example, we will create a database called 'blog'. Within the database, create three tables: 'posts', 'comments', and 'users'. Each table will have specific fields according to what data they will store.

Step 3: Creating a Configuration File

Create a new PHP file, e.g., 'config.php'. This is where we'll put our database credentials so that our PHP scripts can interact with our MySQL database. The code for setting up this file can be as follows:

```php
<?php
$host = "localhost";
$user = "root";
$pass = "";
$db = "blog";

$link = mysqli_connect($host, $user, $pass, $db);

if(!$link) {
   die('Connect Error: ' . mysqli_connect_error());
}
?>
```

Step 4: Setting up the Blog

Next, it's time to delve into PHP coding. You will develop different PHP files for user authentication, displaying posts, adding new posts, adding comments, and much more.

Step 5: User Authentication

You will need to have a system to add and authenticate users. It involves creating PHP scripts for registration and logging in users. MySQL commands can be used to add new users to the 'users' database, and PHP session variables can help manage user login.

Step 6: Adding Posts

To add a new blog post, create a PHP script ('add-post.php') where you can write a blog post and submit it. Use 'POST' method in PHP to store this data into your database.

Step 7: Displaying Posts

Create a script ('display-posts.php') for viewing all the posts. Fetch the posts from the database using MySQL query and use a 'while' loop to display all blog posts in an ordered or unordered list.

Step 8: Commenting on Posts

Implementing a commenting system is the next significant thing. Create a script ('add-comment.php') where users can enter their comments. Use 'POST' method to submit the comment associated with the specific post to the database.

Step 9: Styling the Blog

Use CSS to give your blog an attractive and neat look. One can utilize Bootstrap to ease the process of styling and ensure a responsive design.

Congratulations, you have built a simple blog system with PHP! With this foundation, there are limitless areas for exploration and improvement. Try integrating additional features like categories, multiple admins, a searching system, SEO-friendly URLs, and a rich text editor for writing posts.

Writing a blog in PHP helps understand the server-side operation, manage databases, and manipulate data using PHP and MySQL. Remember, practice is key in mastering any programming language – keep experimenting, keep coding!
